## Simply Download And Run


Download and run the Windows installer from [our website](https://beekeeperstudio.io).

Currently Beekeeper Studio only supports the `x86_64` architecture. Support for `ARM64` will come in a future release.


## Portable Version of Beekeeper Studio

We also have a portable version of Beekeeper Studio that does not require installation. This is also available from our website.
