## Commercial Support

Email support is provided for anyone who has purchased the commercial version of Beekeeper Studio from our website.

We usually respond to requests within working hours (9-5 Mon-Fri), but will sometimes respond to messages at other times if we can.

You can contact support at [support@beekeeperstudio.io](mailto:support@beekeeperstudio.io).

## Community Support

Everyone (commercial and community users) have community resources available to them if they need help.

- Search [our public GitHub issue backlog](https://github.com/beekeeper-studio/beekeeper-studio/issues) for features or bugs that have already been reported.
- Join [our Slack group](https://beekeeperstudio.io/slack) to chat with other users (and us).
