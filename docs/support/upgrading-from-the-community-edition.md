## How to upgrade from the community edition

1. [Download and install the full version of Beekeeper Studio](https://beekeeperstudio.io/get).
1. Open Beekeeper Studio to begin your 14 day free trial.
1. All your connections and settings will transfer over from the community edition automatically.

## Purchases support a small independent team

Beekeeper Studio is run by [one person](https://beekeeperstudio.io/about), with the help of a few part-time freelancers, and of course the Beekeeper Studio [community](https://github.com/beekeeper-studio/beekeeper-studio/graphs/contributors).

Building quality software is hard work, especially for such a small team! Even so -
I'm committed to providing an open source version of Beekeeper Studio, even though it loses me money. Tech accessibility is really important, and not everyone can afford to pay for a database manager. Everyone deserves access to good software.

When you buy a copy of Beekeeper Studio you directly support my business, and our efforts in open source. Thank you! üôè
