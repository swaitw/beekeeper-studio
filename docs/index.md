## What is Beekeeper Studio?

Beekeeper Studio is a database manager and SQL GUI. It is a desktop app that is easy to use. It's a visual alternative to command line tools like `psql` or `mysql`, while also providing a bunch of useful extra features.


Beekeeper Studio comes in two editions:
- **Beekeeper Studio** - The full version of Beekeeper Studio.
- **Beekeeper Studio Community Edition** - A free and open source version of Beekeeper Studio that supports fewer databases and contains fewer features.

These docs and the main website primarily talk about features of the full commercial edition of Beekeeper Studio. See [GitHub](https://github.com/beekeeper-studio/beekeeper-studio) for information on the community edition.
